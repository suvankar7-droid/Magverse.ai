   Example: "ABC" → FAIL ❌

2. Contains "FAIL" (case insensitive)
   Example: "FAIL12345" → FAIL ❌

3. Contains "ERROR" (case insensitive)
   Example: "ERROR123" → FAIL ❌

// Success if:
- Length >= 6 characters
- No "FAIL" keyword
- No "ERROR" keyword
  Example: "ABC123456" → SUCCESS ✅
```

---

## 🔄 Retry Flow

```
